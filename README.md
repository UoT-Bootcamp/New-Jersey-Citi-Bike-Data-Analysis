## Brief Background:

As a new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In my new role, I will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so our task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.
Our team selected New Jersey data to build a dashboard and answer questions of the City Officials.

## Question set and the analysis:

### Questions:

* How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?
* By what percentage has total ridership grown?
* How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

### Analysis:

Total trips recordeed during January till October 2020 is  273,747. There is a increase in the ridership during summer season as people like to do out door activities which includes cycling also. Futher we can also say that due to Covid-19, people ride cycles to avoid public transport. Hence we can see a sudden increase during the month of May 2020. Number of rides taken by the subscribers and customers started increasing from April till September.

### Questions:

* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?
* What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

### Questions:

* Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

They prefer to do cycling to keep themselves fit and healthy.
